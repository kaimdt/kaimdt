##### Hi. I'm Kai, I'm 17 years old and I'm from Germany. I am a self-taught full-stack javascript engineer with 2 years of experience. I am currently training to become an IT specialist for application development. I have always been passionate about programming and have already gained some experience in different areas. As a result, I have specialized in development with NodeJS and Python.

```
I currently develop with:
Node.JS, TypeScript, React, Next.JS and Python
```

Before that I was developing with PHP for a long time.

Go to [my website](https://kaimdt.com) to learn more about me and my projects.
