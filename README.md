# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a 21-year-old **Software Developer** and **CEO** at [Leryon](https://leryon.com). I’ve been passionate about coding since I was 12 years old, and over the years, I’ve turned that passion into my profession. I’m a trained **Application Developer** and love building innovative solutions that push the boundaries of technology.

### A little about me:
- 💻 I've been coding for almost a decade now, and it still feels like day one!
- 🚀 CEO & Lead Developer at [Leryon](https://leryon.com)
- 🎓 Trained as an **Application Developer** (Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwicklung)
- 🌱 Always learning something new—whether it's a new language, framework, or tech trend.
- 🛠️ In my free time, I work on exciting projects with my team at Leryon.

### Languages & Tools:
Here are some of the languages I’m currently working with:

- **TypeScript**
- **JavaScript**
- **Rust**
- **Python**
- **Go**

### What I’m up to:
When I’m not coding or managing projects at Leryon, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or brainstorming the next big thing in software development.
